This is the current progress of me learning the 64 year old programming language COBOL. I have been learning this from Peggy Fisher many regards go out to her and the learning material she provides regarding COBOL. You'll see through the programs the evolution of the learning and how the skills improve.

HelloWorld(CBL)

This is a HelloWorld prompt it'll execute and display message and then stop runnning.

Input(CBL)

Within this program it'll prompt the user to enter their name and then displays a message including their name. When the program is run, it will display a message asking the user to enter their name, and then it will accept the user's input and store it in the variable "NAME". The program will then display a message including the user's name, introducing themselves to the user. The program will then stop running.

BMICALC(CBL)

This will calculate and displays the body mass index (BMI) of the user. When the program is run, it prompts the user to enter their height in inches and their weight in pounds. It then calculates the user's BMI based on this data and displays it to the user. The program stops running after displaying the BMI. The BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = (weight in pounds * 703) / (height in inches * height in inches)

SalesCommissionReport(CBL)

 This Program reads a file containing sales data for multiple sales people and prints a report based on that data. The report includes the total sales for the year, commission earned by each salesperson, and sales broken down by region. The sales data is stored in the file "SALES.DAT" and the report is printed to the file "SALESREPORT.DAT". The program reads the data from "SALES.DAT" line by line and stores it in the record "SALESDETAILS". The report includes a heading line and one detail line for each salesperson. The program calculates the commission earned by each salesperson based on their yearly sales and a predefined commission rate. The program continues to read and process records until it reaches the end of the file, at which point it stops and closes the input and output files.
